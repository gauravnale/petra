						</div>
						<p class="text-justify"><strong>Abstract:<br></strong> In this talk, we provide an overview of our work on computational methods for tracking 
						human motion and for the semantic interpretation of human activities, based on unobtrusive computer vision techniques that rely on the processing 
						and analysis of markerless visual data. We focus on tracking the 3D position, orientation and full articulation of the human body and human body 
						parts and we show how this is employed to solve problems of varying complexity, ranging from 3D tracking of a hand (possibly in interaction with
						objects) up to action recognition, gesture interpretation and intention prediction. Finally, we show how our work can support the development 
						of vision systems aiming at intuitive human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration as well as the development of interactive exhibits 
						in the context of smart environments. </p>

						</div>
						<p class="text-justify"><strong>Abstract:<br></strong> 
						Research is the only way for new Knowledge. We started working with new technologies and patients with cognitive problems since 2005 with the 1st program 
						Long Lasting Memories (LLM) under the umbrella of FP6 EE invitation: Consortium activities and Partners provided the opportunity to validate the LLM 
						deployment potential in three (3) different perspectives: technological, scientific and business (<a href="http://www.longlastingmemories.eu">http://www.longlastingmemories.eu</a>). The first 7 programs 
						have finished and we use the results of them in every day clinical praxis. A 2nd national program (ENNOISIS) started in 2009 (<a href="http://www.ennoisis.gr/ennoisis/">http://www.ennoisis.gr/ennoisis/</a>) 
						which had as target an Ambient Intelligence System (depth cameras and environmental sensors) for the Monitoring, Empowerment and Disease Evolution Prediction 
						for Patients with Μild cognitive impairment. Α project funded by the Greek Government and the European Union. The best result of this program was the Virtual 
						Supermarket which was translated in 6 different languages, has a high sensitivity and specificity for the discrimination of Mild Cognitive Impairment from 
						Healthy age and education-matched controls and also can be used not only for screening of cognitive impairment but also for cognitive empowerment. A 3rd  
						program was also a national program entitled Augmentation of the Support of Patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease and their caregivers (ASPAD/2875)”, 
						which is materialized by the Special Account of the Research Committee at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The project was funded by the European 
						Union (European Social Fund) and the Ministry of Education, Lifelong Learning and Religious Affairs in the context of the National Strategic Reference 
						Framework (NSRF, 2007-2013). It was the first time we communicated with caregivers in areas far away from big cities. Α 4th program “Cognitive Brain signal 
						Processing lab – CBP” is a project funded by the General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT), under the call ARISTEIA, ESPA 2007-2013. 
						(<a href="http//www.cbp.iti.gr">http//www.cbp.iti.gr</a>) It was the first time we tried to analyse Elecrtoenchephalogram (EEG) with a machine with 256 electrodes. The 5th program was an  EU 
						FP7 project Dem@Care: Dementia Ambient Care – Multi-Sensing Monitoring for Intelligent Remote Management and Decision (<a href="http://www.demcare.eu">http://www.demcare.eu</a>) which helped 
						our patients at home and smart homes to have a more active life. A 6th program entitled as “A global ecosystem for the independent and healthy living of 
						elder people with mild cognitive impairments” (ehcoBUTLER) is a Pilot-based, multidisciplinary, collaborative study designed to test the socio-economic 
						benefits from the deployment of several innovative and user led ICT pilot projects based on different business models in order to be able to translate 
						promising results into scalable practice across Europe. (<a/ href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/643566">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/643566</a>). The 7th program was an Erasmus (+) project entitled 
						: “Development of a Training Program for the Improvement of Quality of Life of Persons with Alzheimer through “Serious Games” AD-GAMING” 
						(<a href="http://adgaming.ibv.org /">http://adgaming.ibv.org/</a>. The 8th program was a European program entitled  «Dementia Early Screening and Disease Progression Tracking in the clinical 
						practice by means of ALTOIDA MedTech - ALTOIDA AR». The last two programs are running now. The 9th program is entitled as “Remote Assessment of Disease and 
						Relapse- Alzheimer΄s Disease” (RADAR-AD).  It is a European project to assess the use of Remote Monitoring Technology in detection of impairments in 
						functional components of tasks of daily living that occurred below the threshold of clinical scale detection or disability questionnaires in patients in 
						various stages of AD. <a href="https://www.radar-ad.org/">https://www.radar-ad.org/</a>. And the 10th program entitled as “Bridge” project is a European innovative intergenerational approach 
						using Serious Games for people with dementia. The aims of this project are to develop a set of prototypes Serious Games (SGs) (physical, digital or 
						phygital) acting on cognitive and behavioral symptoms of dementia, involving also younger and older people. (<a href="https://projectbridge.eu/">https://projectbridge.eu/</a>)
