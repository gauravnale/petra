				<h4><span class="text-info">RoSe</span>: 1st International Workshop on Robotics and Sensors for Rehabilitation and Assisted Therapy</h4>

				<p class="text-justify"> Many people suffer from impairments of physical structures or functions, where some are persistent,
				caused by accidents or other diseases such as stroke. Other impairments are reversible by nature (e.g.
				tendon-injuries and the like caused by accidents or post-operative). Such disorders and in succession
				also impairments of related body parts and the musculoskeletal system in general can lead to disability
				and have a severe impact on the affected persons regarding activities of daily living (ADL) in their
				private and working life, their social participation and consequently also their mental health can be
				impaired with diseases like depression.</p>
				<p class="text-justify"> Due to often high costs, in general, medical aids are not available or equally accessible for people at all
				levels of income. Costs is also one reason why the production of rehabilitation devices for home usage
				is not yet well established and available devices aim to be used by professionals (e.g. therapists) and
				therefore exhibit comparably high complexity in usage, application, adjustment and
				configuration. Another consequence is a low grade of individualization of assistive devices which is
				further also a social issue with respect to the resulting stigmatizing due to unaesthetic design, possibly
				leading to social exclusion.</p>
				<p class="text-justify"> Currently, effective rehabilitation requires thoroughly planned therapy sessions in an ambulatory setting
				or in a hospital together with a therapist supervising the trainings. These sessions are time consuming
				and cost-intensive and for people in rural areas there is often no facility within the next 30 –
				40 km. Additionally, rehabilitation is most effective when done promptly after surgery or injury and
				performed with appropriate level of exercise and in a repetitive manner. However, this is often not
				possible due to the limited number of practicing therapists and facilities. Improper fit of the devices and
				resulting pain as well as a lack of intrinsic motivation will reduce the adherence of users and
				consequently also significantly reduce their therapy success with possibly persistent consequences for
				their future life.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">The aforementioned needs consequently call for improved concepts in terms of design, fabrication,
				functionalization, status and progress monitoring through sensor-based feedback as well
				as individualization of rehabilitation devices and therapy robotics. Additionally, we think that novel
				concepts for at home usage and practicability and robustness of the target approaches need to be
				developed. Together with these novel concepts also strategies for accessible data processing and
				visualization need to be addressed in research and development.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">We consequently address advancements addressing the aforementioned social and functional needs of
				devices. A special focus is on strategies to decide which physiological data should be acquired to
				sufficiently monitor and assess movement of patients and users and where is the specific benefit for the
				relevant stakeholders. We also especially encourage rehabilitation robotic and
				assistive devices suitable for at home usage.</p>

				<h5>Topics</h5>
				<p class="text-justify">Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Movement quality monitoring</li>
					<li>Monitoring and Feedback of therapist’s manual support</li>
					<li>Patient monitoring</li>
					<li>Robotics rehabilitation devices and structures</li>
					<li>Sensor and manufacturing principles</li>
					<li>Strategies and motivation/rationale for functionalization</li>
					<li>Robustness and reliability of sensors and devices</li>
					<li>Practicability/usefulness for home usage</li>
					<li>Low threshold accessibility</li>
					<li>Accessible data processing and visualization</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Goals </h5>
				<p class="text-justify"> In this workshop, we consequently want to discuss with and bring together experts from
				interdisciplinary fields such as assistive devices, robotics, sensors as well as fabrication technologies
				and experts from participatory research and healthcare. We want to interactively discuss and foster the
				development of novel ideas and strategies to fill the aforementioned gaps of current technology and
				concepts. Submissions in the field of therapy as well as in user-centered-design and active assisted
				living are highly encouraged. The discussions will take place as Q&A Sessions following the individual
				presentations of the workshop papers.</p>
