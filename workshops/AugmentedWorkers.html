                <h3 style="text-align:center">Augmented worker: Human-centered AI technologies for augmenting human capabilities in industry
                </h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>The fourth industrial revolution brings innovative tools and methods that will permit not only to make machines more
                autonomous and intelligent but they will also to create synergies between these machines and humans. In the spirit of
                Industry 4.0 human intelligence will be combined with machine endurance and computation power to optimize not only
                production but also decision-making processes. In such a context, complementarity between human workers and machines can
                be achieved with a better understanding of human needs. AI driven technologies will anticipate these needs and empower
                workers, will permit them to be liberated from tedious tasks allowing them thus to create added value and to concentrate
                their effort on the development of expert skills.
                Recent advances in motion sensing, data processing and machine learning are opening new perspectives for augmenting
                workers' performance. The possibility to collect human data with non-invasive sensors (e.g. wearables) and to analyze it
                by using AI permits to better monitor human behavior and to bring technological solutions that will make their work more
                efficient and comfortable.</p>

                <p>This workshop will focus on such Human-Centered AI technologies that augment human capabilities. More precisely it will
                permit to present innovative works, methods and tools for the acquisition of human activity related data (worker’s
                motions/postures, his/her physical and/or emotional state e.g. level of fatigue or stress etc.) and on methods for the
                analysis of this data in order to monitor and detect any possible risky patterns such as ergonomic issues or procedural
                incidents (e.g. detecting oversights etc.). It will also cover the topic of interactive systems for assisting the task
                execution/ergonomy improvement by using different modalities and devices (multimodal feedback via tablets, wearables
                etc.) Finally, the use of AI by human operators create a hybrid workforce generating new technological, ethical, legal
                and social challenges. Consequently, more general studies for example on data management (creation of datasets, data
                accessibility etc.) are also welcome.</p>

                <br>

                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>This workshop aims to attract an interdisciplinary group of researchers who are involved in research related to
                Human-Centered AI used to augment the capabilities of workers in industry. It will focus on novel methods and tools that
                permit to collect data, analyse it, model it and to interact/collaborate with the user. The researchers will present
                their work and receive feedback from their peers. As part of the larger theme of the PETRA conference, the participants
                will also have the opportunity to interact with top scientists working with pervasive assistive technologies to exchange
                valuable ideas that could advance the state-of-the-art in the field.</p>
